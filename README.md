# Smart-Contact-Manager

This is a learning Project, the main Objective of this project to create an application which stores contacts in very efficient way and provides a smarter way of handling contacts with fully Authentication and Authorization. We created this project using Spring Boot Thymeleaf with MVC Architecture and for Authentication and Authorization we have used Spring Security.

- Spring Boot is used to develop back-end and Spring Data JPA is used for performing Database CRUD operations.
- HTML5, CSS3 and Thymeleaf as template Engine is used to develop the front end.
- SQLLite3 for Database.

The main objective of java project on Contact Management System is to manage the details of Remainder, Mobiles, Phone Numbers, People, Address. The Project is totally built at administrative end and thus only the administrator is guaranteed the access. In management terminology, advanced contact managers can be called individual resource management (IRM) tools â€“ systems for managing an individual's interactions with current and future contacts, to organize, collaborate, and synchronize health, lifestyle, and financial needs.

For someone who wants to run this application in their IDE's (system or Machine) can simply download and run this without any changes in configuration.
